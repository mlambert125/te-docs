# Tech Elevator NLR Assessment Overview and Rules

## Assessment Structure

- The assessment is three hours long and contains two pieces:
  - A question/answer quiz portion on Bootcamp OS.
  - A coding portion to be pulled from git and then pushed and submitted through Bootcamp OS
- You may complete the portions of the assessment in any order you like, but are encouraged to manage your time appropriately.
- Any submissions of quiz answers or code that are received after the assessment time is over will not be considered.
- The test will begin promptly at class start time.  If you arrive late, have your camera on and your microphone muted and immediately begin working. 
- Once your test is completed, you may wish to verify with the instructor that your work has been properly submitted.
- You may leave the zoom call once you are finished, however, you are encouraged to use the extra time to review your answers and code for errors.
- Once you leave the call, you may **not** rejoin the call or do any further submission of your quiz answers or your code.
- If you have a medical reason or other valid reason for needing extra time for your assessment, please contact your instructor in advance for approval and to make arrangements.

## Assessment Preparation

- The assessment covers material from **all** parts of the module.  Students are encouraged to study and prepare resources accordingly.
- As you are allowed to use notes for the assessment, you should make sure your notes are complete, present and organized before the assessment date.
- A practice assessment will be made available during the week before the assessment.  
  - It is **strongly** recommended that you complete this practice assessment, as it is a very similar assessment and a strong indicator of where you stand and where you need work to prepare fo the assessment.

## Assessment Environment Rules

- You must be in the zoom call with your camera on and be seated in front of your camera/laptop for the full duration of the assessment.
  - Exceptions are made for short breaks to use facilities, to get a drink, etc.  Please inform your instructor during these breaks, and please keep the time and frequency of breaks to a minimum.
- You must keep your microphone muted during the zoom call unless you are requesting technical help from the instructor.
- You must be awake, responsive and exclusively working on your assessment for the duration of the assessment.
- You must be alone during the zoom call.  Other people being in the background on occasion is fine, but you may not have someone sitting with you or otherwise constantly interacting with you during the assessment.
- All other rules for NLR class time apply during the assessment.

## Instructor / Proctor

- An instructor or other academic staff member will be present to monitor and proctor your test taking.  
- The proctor is available to you **only to address technical issues**, for example:
  - Help with issues logging into BootCamp OS
  - Help with issues pulling or pushing the coding content to/from GitLab
  - Help with zoom issues
- The proctor is **NOT** able to assist you with issues related to the material, for example:
  - They can **NOT** help you directly or indirectly with answering quiz questions
  - They can **NOT** look at your code and offer feedback or explain an error.  This includes errors that are entirely preventing a build.
  - They can **NOT** help you understand error messages or test failures
  - They can **NOT** clarify the meaning or intention of a quiz question or a requirement in the coding portion.
    - The ability to understand and translate requirements is part of your education and part of the assessment.
