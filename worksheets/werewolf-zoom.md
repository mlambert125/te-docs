# Werewolf on Zoom

## Overview

Werewolf is a social deduction game about a village that has been invaded
by werewolves.  At the start of the game everyone is secretly assigned a role.

The roles used and number of characters depends on the number of players.  In general, the moderator tries to balance the game so that the
character weights add up to 0.  

| Role       | Weight | Description                                                          |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Villager   | +1     | A normal villager with no special abilities or rules                 |
| Werewolf   | -6     | Knows other werewolves, cooperates with them to eat a villager at night.                   |
| Seer       | +7     | Can check if another player is werewolf every night                  |
| Bodyguard  | +3     | Can protect a player from werewolves at night                        |
| Hunter     | +3     | Can exile another player as a last action if/when they are exiled    |
| Tanner     | -1     | Special villager who is trying to get exiled before the game ends    |

Your role is secret the entire game, however, you are allowed to tell the rest of the village your
role if you wish (no direct messaging other than werewolves at night.)  You may also lie about your role and/or
alignment.

The game is played as a series of alternating day and night phases until the werwolves are all dead (villagers win)
or the werewolves match the number of villagers (werewolves win.)  Once you are removed from the game, the
moderator will announce your specific role to the remaining villagers and you must turn off your camera and microphone and 
leave them off until the next game starts. Once you have been removed, you may not speak any parting words.

## Day Phase
During the day, everyone in the village (wolves and villagers) choose a suspicious villager who should be exiled under suspicion of 
being a werewolf.   Anyone can nominate another player to be exiled.  Once a nomination is seconded,
the moderator will allow some discussion and then call for a vote.  If a majority of the village (excluding
the accused) votes for the player to be exiled, that player is removed from the game and the
game immediately goes to night time.  If a player is voted on and is not exiled, they can not be
reconsidered for the rest of that day.  The day phase continues until someone is exiled, all options 
have been exhausted, or a majority vote not to exile anyone that day.

Once someone has been exiled, the game immediately goes to night (NO talking after execution.)  For the night
phase, everyone turns of their cameras and mutes their microphones.

## Night Phase

At night, the werewolves talk amongst eachother via direct message and choose a villager to eat that night 
and inform the moderator through direct message.  Also, all special roles are asked in turn to perform their action by 
direct messaging the moderator.  

Dialog from moderator goes something like this:

- "Seer, direct message me someone's alignment to check, and I will reply with V or W."
- "Bodyguard message me with someone to protect."
- "Wolves, message eachother and agree on someone to eat, then one of you direct message me with your choice."

When the night ends, everyone turns on their cameras and microphones and the moderator announces
who (if anyone) was eaten by werewolves during the night, and the day phase begins again.

## Starting the Game

The game starts with a very short night phase where only the seer acts (no one is eaten, etc.)  The moderator
will ask the seer to message with an alignment to check, respond, and then immediately move to the first day.

## Rules

- No direct messaging other players except between wolves at night time.
- Cameras must be on during the day and off at night.
- Microphones must be off at night
- Nominating, and seconding is done by speaking out loud.
- Voting is done via zoom hand raise.  Voting will be done immediately after a countdown by the moderator to 
ensure votes are not influenced by eachothers votes.

## Strategy

-  In general, the seer is trying to remain hidden as the werewolves would eat them next if they knew, since
they are the most powerful villager.  However, it may be tactical to reveal this sometimes.
- Wolves may want to present themselves as seer to create an argument as to who the real seer is.
- The bodyguard should try to find and protect the seer.
- The tanner's win condition is entirely based upon trying to be removed, however, he is not a tactical choice for 
either team to choose to remove.  This means that as tanner, you generally want to look like a wolf.
- You are never without information.  Remeber that SOMEONE in the village knows one alignment for each day 
that has passed, and pay careful attention to how people vote, nominate, etc.
